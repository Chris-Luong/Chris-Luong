UNSW Business Society is the largest society at the University of New South Wales with over 11,000 members and the society hosts 75+ events every year. These events are aimed at fostering the devlopment of students from the Business School by enhancing their social, personal and professional skills.

I used Webflow to create the website and make it responsive with my co-director and Godadddy to host it. The website contains multiple pages showcasing different aspects of the society including a blog page to give students information on various topics and a signup page to allow people to signup to the mailing list.
